<h1>Sorting Visualizer</h1>
<p>This project is a sorting visualizer built using Python and Tkinter.</p>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Visualization of Sorting Algorithms:
    <ul>
      <li>The project provides visualizations for various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort, and Selection Sort.</li>
      <li>Each algorithm is visually represented on the canvas, showing the step-by-step sorting process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Customizable Number of Blocks:
    <ul>
      <li>Users can customize the number of blocks used in the sorting visualization.</li>
      <li>The number of blocks can be adjusted using a slider in the configuration window, allowing users to see the sorting algorithms in action with different block sizes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    User-Friendly Interface:
    <ul>
      <li>The project offers a user-friendly interface with intuitive buttons and controls.</li>
      <li>Users can start the sorting animation by clicking the play button.</li>
      <li>They can pause the animation at any time by clicking the pause button.</li>
      <li>The configuration window provides options to modify the number of blocks and select the desired sorting algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Analysis Space:
    <ul>
      <li>The project includes an analysis space where users can explore additional information related to the sorting algorithms.</li>
      <li>Regression Plots: Users can view regression plots that demonstrate the time complexity of each sorting algorithm based on the number of elements.</li>
      <li>Code and Complexity Information: The analysis space provides code snippets and information about the space and time complexity of each sorting algorithm, helping users understand their implementation and performance characteristics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
